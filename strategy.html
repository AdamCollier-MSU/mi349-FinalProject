                    <h2 id="get-started-heading">Getting Started</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">When you complete the gta online tutorial and it throws you into a free roam loby, your first goal is to get enough money to register as a <a href="info.html#CEO/VIP">VIP</a>. One method to hit this target is to hold up convenience stores, which you can find on the map, and typically yield 2 to 3 thousand $gta. Another approach is to sell higher end street cars at a <em>los santos custom</em> body shop, which will yield up to 10,000 $gta with a 40 minute cooldown between sales.A third method is to try and join someone elses CEO/VIP/MC organization, although this is not completely reliable since many players may not be willing to hire a low-level</p>

                    <h2 id="VIP/Equipment">VIP Work and Equipment</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">Once you are able to register as a VIP, you want to start these jobs through the interaction menu. I would recomend alternating between the sightseer and headhunter jobs. If it takes you an average of 15 minutes to do each job, including cooldown, this will make you up to 80k per hour. This is also a good stage to start working on getting decent weapons and equipment with the money you make from this method. I would focus on getting a rifle, snacks and bodyarmor</p>

                <div id="business's-section">
                    <h2 id="business's">Aquiring Business's and Properties</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">Once you get the basic equipment and a decent reserve of cash, I would recomend buying the cheapest clubhouse, as this gives you permanent access to freeroam jobs, and sets you up to get Motorcycle Club bussiness's in the future. For Your first actual bussiness, I would recomend getting the cheapest hangar, since it does not cost money to source cargo. Next I would suggest buying the cheapest CEO office to gain permanent access to VIP work and set you up to buy warehouses in the future. Once you reach this point, the bussiness's you buy are mostly preference; however, I would advice against buying the weed or document forgery business's if you intend to buy supplies, since they will turn a negligible profit under these conditions.</p>

                <div id="Heists">
                    <h2>Heists</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">Heists can be a good way to make money and are more fun than running business's. However, I would strongly advice against playing with people who do not have microphones, as communication is very important on higher difficulties. I would also caution exremely low levels against playing most heists, as the low health and limited snack, bodyarmor, and amo capacity will make it extremely difficult to complete the majority of the heists. I would recomend starting with the first few apartment heists after reaching level 50 and see what dificulty works for you. As far as money and xp go, it's better to complete the heist on a lower dificulty than spend several hours stuck on a higher difficulty.</p>
