                    <h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">This section will introduce some of the equipment types that you will want to aquire as you play the game, as well as details on how to aquire some of the more important items.</p>
                    <h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">The weapons that you can aquire in gta are seperated into many different categories: rifles, smg's, mg's, snipers, heavy weapons, grenades to name a few. With a few exceptions, these weapons can be purchased from the ingame gun stores, <em>Ammunation</em> if you have enough money and have reached the required level for a given weapon. Weapons can be customized with various attachments and paintjobs at any Ammunation. Some weapons can also be upgraded to a mk2 variant using a weapon workbench in either a MOC or Avenger, which will be discussed in the <a href="#vehicles">vehicles section</a>. Ammunition for your weapons can  either be purchased at Ammunation or through the interaction menu.</p>

                    <h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">There are many categories of vehicles in this game, some of the more important ones being: super, sport, weaponized and mission. All the vehicles are aquired through in-game websites that can be accesed through the in-game phone. Some vehicles can also be purchased at a discount if you have completed certain challenges or missions. Super and Sport cars are the main racing and showoff cars available in gta, some of the popular ones being the krieger and vagner, and are only essential to have if you plan to compete in races. These types of vehicles can be purchased on the websites <em>Legendary Motersport</em> or <em>Southern San Andreas Super Autos</em>. These, and other non-weaponized vehicles, can be upgraded in any <em>los santos custom</em> body shop</p>
                    <p class="textbox">Weaponized vehicles is a broad category that includes ground, air, and sea vehicles that are equipt with mounted weapons and/or explosive resistant armor. Examples include the Oppressor mk2 (commonly called a broomstick), lazer buzzard and vigilante. These vehicles are only upgradable in specific vehicle bays tied to properties and mission vehicles. Aircraft can only be upgraded at a hangar you own, ground vehicles at a vehicle bay in an MOC or Avenger and the oppressor mk2 in a terrobyte. These vehicles are purchased through the in-game website <em>Warstock-Cache-And-Carry</em>.</p>
                    <p class="textbox">Mission vehicles are a select category of vehicle that include an interior that requires a loading screen to enter and a capacity to start certain types of missions. These include the Mobile Operation Center(MOC), Avenger, Terrobyte, Kosatka. These vehicles, with the exception of the kosatka, can only be aquired if you already own the property that they are stored at. The MOC requires a <a href="#bunker">bunker</a>, the avenger a <a href="#hangar">hangar</a> or facility and the terrobyte a nightclub. The terrobyte also has the unique ability to allow players to access the management systems for various business's, most notably the <a href="#crates-warehouse">crates</a> and <a href="#vehicle-warehouse">vehicle</a> warehouses.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="business's-section">
                    <h2 id="Business's-Heading">Business's</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">Business's in gta are a subset of properties that provide income for players and are managed in a regular, 30 player lobby. Each bussiness property has multiple location options for you to choose from, certain locations being more expensive than others; however, you can only have one propery for each business, the only exception being the crates warehouses. Bussiness's also require the player to either have a CEO and/or a Motorcycle Club.</p>

                    <h3 id="CEO/VIP">CEO Business's and VIP work</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">CEO business's are managed and purchased through a player owned office building, which are purchased through the in-game website <em>dynasty8executiverealty</em>. Sell missions are initiated from the computer in the warehouse you wish to sell from. VIP work is also available by registering as a CEO, which requires an office, or as a VIP, which requires you have at least 50,000 gta currency. CEO's and VIP's are able to hire other players as associates to help in managing business's or VIP work.</p>
                    <h4 id="crates-warehouse">Crates Warehouse</h4>
                    <p class="textbox">Crates warehouses are a type of CEO business in which you source crates of various illicit goods to resell at a profit. Crate warehouses come in small, medium, and large sizes and you can own more than one. Crates are sourced by interacting with the computer in your office or through the terrobyte, and can be purchased in groups of one, two, or three. Buying in bulk allows you to fill up the warehouse at the fastest rate, but reduces the profit made on individual sales. Sourcing missions will either send you to fetch each crate individually or after a vehicle that holds all the crates you sourced. Sell missions will empty your warehouse into either air, land, or sea delivery vehicle(s), the size and number of vehicles being determined by the amount of crates being sold.  </p>
                    <h4 id="vehicle-warehouse">Vehicle Warehouse</h4>
                    <p class="textbox">vehicle warehouses allow you to steal, customize and resell expensive cars. Sourcing missions will send you to collect a car from either the top, mid, or low range categories(in order from most to least valuable) and return it to the warehouse, deducting any damages done to the vehicle from your in-game bank account. The probabilty of you getting a certain range of car in a source mission is determined by the vehicle composition of your warehouse; for instance, a warehouse with mostly low to mid range vehicles will most likely give you top range source missions. The number of cars you can sell is determined by the number of associates in your organization. There are three types of sell mission, the highest tier will give you maximum profit but will cost $20,000 gta to initiate where the lowest tier costs nothing but has the lowest profit margin. As with the source missions, any damages done to the vehicle during a sale will be deducted from the money you make.</p>

                    <h3 id="Motorcycle-Club">Motorcycle Club</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">Motorcycle clubs (MC's) are unlocked by purchasing a <em>clubhouse</em> from the <em>Maze Bank Foreclosure</em> in-game website. This property gives you access to a computer that will allow you to purchase illicit business's and a conference room that will allow you to start jobs within the lobby. There are also jobs that can be started from the interaction menu, but these are far less extensive than those offered in VIP work.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="mc-bussiness's">MC Bussiness's</h4>
                    <p class="textbox">The five types of MC business's are <em>Cocaine Lockup</em>, <em>Meth Lab</em>, <em>Counterfeit Cash</em>, <em>Weed Farm</em> and <em>Document Forgery</em>, in order from most to least profitable. These business's are all managed in the same way, where the business consumes supplies and produces the given product to be sold by the player. Supplies can either be stolen, which increases the profit margin at the expense of manually resupplying the business, or bought, which costs gta money but automatically resupplies the business. Sell missions completely empty the business into one or more delivery vehicles. These business's can also be upgraded, throught the computer inside the bussiness, by buying better equipment, more personel, and better security; the first two upgrades increases the efficiency of production while security reduces the likelihood that your business will be raided and product stolen.</p>

                    <h3 id="bunker">Bunker</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">Bunkers function in a very similar way to <a href="#mc-bussiness's">mc business's</a>, where supplies are bought or stolen, product(weapons) is sold, and upgrades can be bought. The main difference is that the bunker has three production settings: manufacturing, research, and both. manufacturing uses all supplies to produce product to sell, research uses supplies to unlock upgrades for weapons and vehicles, and both uses supplies to produce both at half efficiency for each. Bunkers are bought and upgraded through <em>Maze Bank Foreclosures</em>; the exception to this is production and security upgrades, which are bought through the computer in the bunker</p>

                    <h3 id="hangar">Hangar</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">Hangar's are most similar to the <a href="#crates-warehouse">crates warehouse</a>, where you source crates of various goods and return them to the hangar to be sold. The main differences are that there is no cost to sourcing crates, the number of crates you can source at a time is dependent on the number of people in your organization or MC, and a vehicle is provided to you at the start of the mission. Sell missions are also slightly different as you can choose to sell all of your crates or only crates of a specific type. Hangars can be purchased and upgraded through <em>Maze Bank Foreclosures</em></p>
                    <h3 id="nightclub">Nightclub</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">Nightclubs are unique among the business's in that they are completely passive, with the exception of sell missions. Nightclubs work by assigning technicians to your other business's (usually coke, meth, counterfeit cash, bunker, and hangar) and gradually fill the nighclub storage areas. Nightclubs are upgraded through <em>Maze Bank Foreclosures</em> and the computer inside like bunkers and hangars.</p>

                <div id="heists-section">
                    <h2 id="heists">Heists</h2>
                    <p class="textbox">Heists and Missions are jobs that put you in a co-op loby with one to six players in order to complete an objective. Each heist requires you to own a certain type of property in order to be the host. Each heists has setup missions to be completed in order to move on the the heist finale. </p>

                    <h3 id="apartment-heists">Apartment Heists</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">The apartment heists are the original five heists added to gta online, and you must have a high end apartment in order to host one of these heists. The five heists, in order of unlock, are <em>Fleeca Job</em>, <em>Prison Break</em>,<em>Humane Labs</em>, <em>Series A Funding</em> and <em>Pacific Standard</em>. Each of these heists require four players in order to play, Fleeca Job being the exception with 2 players, with non-hosts being paid for each setup and the host setting each members cut for the finale.</p>

                    <h3 id="doomsday-heists">Doomsday Heists</h3>
                    <p class="textbox">The doomsday heist is split into three parts, each with it's own setups and finale</p>
