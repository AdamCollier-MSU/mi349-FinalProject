                    <p class="textbox">This site is broken up into 3 pages: Home, Information, and Strategy. Each page has a navigation bar at the top of the page that will allow you to navigate between each page. Each page also has a Tabel Of Contents that can be toggled by pressing the blue <em>TOC</em> button in the top left of the page. Each element in the Table Of Contents is clickable and will position the clicked-on section on your screen.The Information page provides essential information about various aspects of the game. The Strategy page is a guide on how to efficiently jumpstart your GTA career. A key thing to note is that the information page was selected and organized based on category and importance, and should not be treated as a step by step guide in how to efficiently play the game. This differs from the strategy page, which was written so that the content you should tackle first is towards the top of the page, and content you may want to wait on is further down the page. It is also important to note that this site, at this point in time, is only a starting point and experience will be your best teacher in learning the ins and outs of this game. As you start building up your collection of weapons, vehicles and business's, you should experiment to find what strategies works best for you. </p>

                    <p class="textbox">I'm an experienced gta online veteran whith aproximately 3000 cumulative hours since 2016. I've also leveled up 2 characters to high triple digit levels from level zero, and know from personal experience how hard it is for new players to navigate the overwhelming amount of content. My hope is to share my experiences in what does and does not work when trying to catch up to players with a several year head start. I also hope that I can show new players that it isn't necessary to spend hundreds of dollars of real money in order to catch up in this game. </p>
